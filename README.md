# OverComplicated-Blinking-Led

<pre>
  This is a over-complicated blinking-LED project that uses potentiometers to control delays and have more features than a simple blink.

  NOTE: The same code can be used on Arduino NANO without any changes but you will need to change pin numbers for arduino mega.
  NOTE: If you are changing pin numbers, remember to use PWM pins for the best perfomance.
  NOTE: You can refer to the TinkerCAD screenshot attached for connections and more details.

  You can follow the connections in the image.
  The 'sketch_jun03' is the main code.
  The 'TEST_code' is a IDE test code.

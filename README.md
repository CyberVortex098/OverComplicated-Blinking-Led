# OverComplicated-Blinking-Led

<pre>
  This is a over-complicated blinking-LED project that uses potentiometers to control delays and have more features than a simple blink.

  NOTE: The same code can be used on Arduino NANO without any changes but you will need to change pin numbers for arduino mega.
